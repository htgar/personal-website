description: The new and improved blog
---

For those of you following this blog, you'd have noticed that I haven't posted in over a year. You'd probably also notice that the blog looks very, very different.

Over the last year, I have had my fair share of commitments, and regrettably could not spend much time on this blog. Now that I am back to working on the blog, I have opted to redesign it from scratch, instead of using someone else's premade theme. Satnaing's [_AstroPaper_ theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper), which is what I used before, has been amazing, but with the frequent developments in web-dev land, it has become a struggle to maintain. 

To that end, I have opted for a bare-bones redesign. I have used the wonderful [PicoCSS](https://picocss.com/) as a styling base, and worked my way from there. No fancy React Components, just the bare basics. That said, this is not the final design, and I am in the process of adding more flourishes to make this site more eye-catching.

Finally, I am experimenting with shorter-form posts like this one for future posts as well, in addition to more structured longer-form ones, like my previous post. Do stay tuned, and follow the [RSS Feed](/rss.xml) to keep up to date with the latest posts!
