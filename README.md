# Htgar's Personal Website

This blog is made using [Astro](https://astro.build), using the [_AstroPaper_ theme](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) by Satnaing. I have included some excerpts from the theme's README here for my convenience.

If you want to replicate my website, I recommend you start with the theme template as linked above, for a smoother experience. Any **major** changes to the theme that I have made will be included in the README if I choose to make such changes.

## 🧞 Commands
